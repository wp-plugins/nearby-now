The Nearby Now Plugin allows you to display your recent checkins and service area heat-map.

== Description ==

[Nearby Now](http://www.nearbynow.co) for Wordpress is an awesome way to add your live Nearby Now checkins and reviews right to your website. The plugin can be displayed in two ways:

###Recent Reviews

One of the most useful features of Nearby Now is the ability to send your customers a review form before you leave their driveway. Since all reviews are tied to checkins, Nearby Now is able to geocode those views and display them on the Nearby Network map.

The Recent Reviews plugin allows you to display the recent reviews right on your website, including a map, and a listing of the reviews.

###Service Area Map &amp; Recent Checkins

If you are using Nearby Now, it means you are building a service area that represents the area you work, and the neighborhoods you service the most. Your service area and heat map are displayed on the Nearby Now network, but we also want you to display the same service area and heat map on your own website or blog.

The Service Area &amp; Recent Checkins plugin was built just for that. A simple way to display your service area, heat map, and recent checkins for your customers to see.

###Configuration

Both plugins can be configured to display a certain location (city/state), as well as a map zoom level, a radius around the city, and the number of items you'd like to show. This is very helpful for those businesses that have multiple locations and host a page for each location and would like to display the plugin data in that locations context.

##How do these plugins help you?

The Nearby Now plugins for Wordpress help your SEO in two ways:

- You can create a web page for each city you service with unique reviews and checkins. Google and other search engines prefer that your website has unique content per page. Duplicate and static content is much less valuable, and Nearby Now is a great way to build that unique dynamic content and plug it into your site.
- The data that is published by the Nearby Now plugin is coded in optimized micro-formats. This helps search engines recognize the value of the reviews and checkins being published.
